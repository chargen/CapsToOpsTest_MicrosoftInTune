# Existing company email account found
You already have a company email account. To continue to connect to your company email, youâ€™ll need to take the following steps to enable your IT admin to properly set up and manage your account:

1. In **Settings** on your device, remove the connection you previously set up to your company email.

   For example, on an iOS device, tap **Settings** &gt; **Mail, Contacts, Calendar**. Select your work email account, and then click **Delete**.

2. Open the company portal app on your device and tap **Check Compliance**.

3. Wait a short time for new email settings to be applied to your device automatically.

If new email settings do not appear after a while, contact your IT admin.
