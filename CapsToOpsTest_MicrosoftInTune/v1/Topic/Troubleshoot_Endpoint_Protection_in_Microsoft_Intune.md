|**Malware definitions out-of-date** <br /> <br />|The computer might have been disconnected from the Internet for an extended period of time, and its malware definitions might not yet have been updated. This status appears when the malware definitions on the computer are out-of-date by 14 days or more. <br /> <br />|If malware definitions are out-of-date, you can update the definitions from the [!INC[wit_adminconsole](../Token/wit_adminconsole_md.md)] or from the managed computer. <br /> <br />For more information, see [Help secure Windows PCs with Endpoint Protection for Microsoft Intune](../Topic/Help_secure_Windows_PCs_with_Endpoint_Protection_for_Microsoft_Intune.md) topic. <br /> <br />|
|**Full scan overdue** <br /> <br />|A full scan has not been completed for 14 days. This can be caused by a computer restart during a full scan. <br /> <br />|If a full scan is overdue, you can run a one-time full scan or schedule recurring full scans from the [!INC[wit_adminconsole](../Token/wit_adminconsole_md.md)] by using the information in the topic [Common Windows PC management tasks with the Microsoft Intune computer client](../Topic/Common_Windows_PC_management_tasks_with_the_Microsoft_Intune_computer_client.md). <br /> <br />|
|**Quick scan overdue** <br /> <br />|A quick scan has not been completed for 14 days.

|**Another endpoint protection application running** <br /> <br />|Another endpoint protection application is running, and the computer is healthy. <br /> <br />|By default, if another endpoint protection application is installed and [!INC[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)]detects that application, [!INC[epshort](../Token/epshort_md.md)] automatically disables itself. If [!INC[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] does not detect the other endpoint application, [!INC[epshort](../Token/epshort_md.md)] will remain enabled.
