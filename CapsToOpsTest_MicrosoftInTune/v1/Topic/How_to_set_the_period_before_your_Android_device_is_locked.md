To reconnect to your work, youâ€™ll need to set the password timeout on your device by following these instructions:

1. In **Settings** on your device, click **Security** &gt; **Automatically Lock** (this appears as **Lock phone after** on some devices).

   If **Automatically Lock** (**Lock phone after** on some devices) is not displayed, ensure that you have set a valid password under **Settings** &gt; **Screen Lock** &gt; **Password**.

2. Specify the password timeout value.

3. Ensure that your device is enrolled with [!INC[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)] by following the instructions in [Enroll your device to use it at work](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=519071).
