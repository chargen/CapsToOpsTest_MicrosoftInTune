# robstack - Understand how Intune service updates affect you
Because [!INC[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] is an online service, Microsoft can update it on a regular basis.

Use the information in this topic to help you understand the frequency of these service updates, and the advance notification we give to you when an update might affect your use of the service.

The [Microsoft Intune Blog](http://blogs.technet.com/b/microsoftintune/) helps keep you up to date with changes in the service, and helpful tips to enable you to get the most from Intune.

Additionally, important service updates will be communicated to you directly from the [!INC[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] in the notice board.
