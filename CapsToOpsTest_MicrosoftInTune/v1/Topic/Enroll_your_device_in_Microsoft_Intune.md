# Enroll your device in Microsoft Intune
If your company is using [!INC[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)] to manage devices, you can help keep corporate data and resources protected by enrolling your phone or tablet into Microsoft Intune. Once you enroll, you can use your mobile phone or tablet to access the company's network, email and other work files and to get company apps. IT will be able to manage limited aspects of your mobile device to keep us protected. You'll still have  access to personal apps and data, and  your private stuff is still for your eyes only.
